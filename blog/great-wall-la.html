                    <h2>The LA River: A Misunderstood Landmark</h2>
                    <p>I thought I knew everything about my home, "the valley." My two-hundred-sixty-square-mile paradise—homes, malls, schools—and, "Oh, the LA River, a half-pipe with some water in it, maybe a stream." My opinions stemmed from news stories like, "Bodies Found In LA River," and its dry, uninspiring appearance. Road signs with a graceful white crane and the words "Los Angeles River" attempted to mask the sheer, concrete plainness. For eighteen years, crossing the joke of a river on the Corbin Avenue bridge left me indifferent. Scattered graffiti enveloped its channel walls. A sea of plastic bottles and trash bags drifted across muddy concrete. My first sight of the river was nothing but an open sewer-dump to my eyes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Looks can be deceiving.</p>

                    <h2>Discovering the Great Wall of Los Angeles</h2>
                    <p>Just a few miles east of the Corbin Avenue bridge, my friend Alex Pang and I discovered something remarkable. Near Los Angeles Valley College, the same channel carved into the landscape was anything but an eyesore. At first, I was an outsider—a blank canvas—eyeing colorful concrete that seemed to transport us through time. "How could this be the same LA River running through Corbin?" The lack of graffiti on the channel was striking, especially in a city like Los Angeles. Grand trees blanketed the fences enclosing the river. Lush grass and bushes hosted scurrying squirrels along adjacent sidewalks. The tranquility was a stark contrast to the rush of cars nearby. People strolled along the walkway, occasionally glancing at a beautiful sight before them: The Great Wall of Los Angeles.</p>

                    <h2>A Walk Through History</h2>
                    <p>This half-mile-long mural sprawled across the channel walls, depicting almost the entirety of California's and Los Angeles's history in a vivid timeline. Ancient Native American symbols and ideologies caught my eye as we stared down the never-ending artwork. Supposedly the largest mural in the world, it was meticulously crafted, romantic in its portrayal of the past. The names of hundreds of contributors lined the walls, evoking immense respect. Pang and I decided to take it all in, starting at the southern end where we were greeted by saber-toothed tigers and mammoths trudging through the La Brea Tar Pits. The mural unfolded a story: Chumash Indian spirits followed by Spanish settlement, the oppression of the Chinese, southern migration, Jewish empowerment, and Civil Rights. It was a long walk through history, highlighting events central to marginalized communities who had shaped the region.</p>
                    
                    <p>Seconds turned into minutes, and the hour we spent gazing felt like three. Our drive back to UCLA was filled with reflection.</p>

                    <h2>More Than Just Beautification</h2>
                    <p>The Great Wall of Los Angeles transformed a dull, concrete structure into a destination, showcasing beautification efforts from the late twentieth century. The murals made the river channel appealing, creating an outdoor museum. The trees and park strip running alongside the channel invited visitors to walk, linger, and engage with history.</p>
                    
                    <p>The mural vividly expressed the experiences of historically disadvantaged peoples, offering fellow Angelenos a way to connect with the past. Many of the contributors, linked to these marginalized families, used the wall as a canvas to articulate their struggles and hopes for the future.</p>

                    <h2>A Unifying Symbol</h2>
                    <p>The timeline emphasized the city's evolution. Depictions of suffering were followed by cultural and societal advancements, symbolizing progress. The mural was a celebration of interracial harmony, portraying Los Angeles's history not just as one of hardship but as a source of inspiration for future positive change. For me, this unifying message was the Great Wall's core purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>The mural welcomed all who came to see it. I felt acknowledged, treated to an educational and emotional journey. Humbled by the tenacity and development embedded in my city's history, I walked away with immense pride for Los Angeles.</p>

                    <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
                    <p>Even the absence of graffiti felt like a testament to how much Angelenos respect the Great Wall and its history. Despite never hearing about it until recently, I could confidently call it a landmark. The mural occupies public consciousness, inspiring peace and pride. As Blake Gumprecht wrote in The Los Angeles River, the river was central to the city's growth, much like how the Great Wall unites the community. Implicit in its artistry is a call to action: to continue societal progress and add new chapters to Los Angeles's story.</p>
